## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- A major takeaway for me was the use of fit-content on the card text elements which ensured the elements only took the width they needed & did not grow to take the full row in flexbox.

### Useful resources

The following resources helped me get a better understanding of flexbox in general.
